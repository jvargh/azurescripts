<# Check for VM's/Disks which are not protected by Azure Backup/ASR, scoped to a particular resource group.

This checks for a number of failure modes whereby your VM's may not be replicated, or partially replicated:

1. If backup is not enabled for the VM.
2. If backup is enabled, but paused.
3. If backup is enabled, but newly added data disks are not picked up for backup. (See: 'Include Future Disks' setting in advanced plan)
4. If backup is enabled, but first backup is still pending.
5. If backup is enabled, but status is not 'Healthy'.
6. If backup is enabled, but pre-checks are not passed.
7. If backup is enabled, but initial backup is not complete
8. If backup is enabled, but the most recent backup is older than 90 days.
9. If replication is not configured for the VM.
10. If replication is configured, but newly created data disks are not picked up for replication.

Checks made:

4. Backup pre-checks are passed
5. Most recent backup is inside some minimum value (sample script is 90 days)
6. Checks to ensure all data disks have their LUN's listed to be protected
